Cosang_v18.2:

Extrap.c was created.

Extrapolation was added to correct for certain galaxy parameters between snapshots.


Cosang_v18.1:

Mass adjustment has been added to subtract mass from particles within in the virial radius based on the galaxy mass.



Cosang_v18:

Memory bugs from version 17.2 have been resolved.

Disk orientation has been added.

disk_orient.c was created

Restarting from a previous snapshot works now but the command has changed from

2 snapshot#  to  2 0 snapshot#



Cosang_v17.2:

Several memory errors have been fixed but some still remain.  If you are having constant crashes add:

export MALLOC_CHECK_=3 

to your shell script file before the executable command.



Cosang_v17: version up to 2/14/2015

Makefile has option added tree_sage_run which runs the codes but does not add in extra forces.

tree_sage_run must be turned on if THIS_IS_A_COSANG_RUN is active

The Treefile.txt and sagefile.txt do not have to be reset when restarting the files will be overwritten if they exist

To run just Gadget: ./P-Gadget3 <Path to Gadget Parameter file>
To run everything:  ./P-Gadget3 <Path to Gadget Parameter file> <Path to Sage Parameter file>
To restart: ./P-Gadget3 <Path to Gadget Parameter file> <Path to Sage Parameter file> 1
To restart if the tree code and sage did not run due to zero Halos found up to the restartfile time: 
		./P-Gadget3 <Path to Gadget Parameter file> <Path to Sage Parameter file> 1 1

Force equations have been added to CoSANG which include: Bulge, BH, Radial and Vertical disk forces.



Cosang_v16: version up to 12/4/2014

Fixed SAGE metallicity array which was not being reset after each snapshot.

Results from Cosang ZeroForce should be same as if all codes were run independently.


README version 10.2

Efficiency mpi changes in progress lastest version up to date 09/09/2014.


README for Cosang_v7:

Files have been added to read the subfind files and find the particles belonging to the halos with galaxies.

Luke provided a hash table file to use to match and find the particle ids on the processors.

Match_ids() is called in gravtree.c
  -This calls the functions to read the subfind files and link up the particles 
  -It also calls the force and potential functions for the galaxies.

NOTE: For future issues with All.TimeMax

In run.c the statement if(All.Ti_Currne >= TIMEBASE) was changed to if(All.Time >= All.TimeMax)
because Ti_Current was not working for a 1 interval snapshot run and would not match TIMEBASE
in time for TimeMax and continue running the simulation past this point.


The Merger Tree code has been integrated

SAGE has been integrated

This is a working code that runs the tree code and Sage after every snapshot is created.
